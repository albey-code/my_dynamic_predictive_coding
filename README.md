# my_dynamic_predictive_coding

This repository holds my adaptation of the dynamic predictive coding (DPC) model by Jiang & Rao (2024). I first trained and tested the DPC model on the original natural forest movie data and then used the pre-trained weights to test the model on new, unseen data. The testing data I used is from a naturalistic movie stimulus called Birdman. Importantly, the Birdman movie was filmed with almost no cuts and therefore allows for continuous perception. Conversely to the natural forest movie, which shows a stroll through a forest, the Birdman movie features complex social interaction incl. movement and facial expression. 

The same code can also be found in all_predictive_coding together with image and fMRI (pre-)processing steps.
